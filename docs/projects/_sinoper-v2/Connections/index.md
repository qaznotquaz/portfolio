Sinoper's Connections are individual classes and libraries that extend his capabilities and allow him to connect to external tools. For example, his [SinoperTwitchUser](tw-user) connection provides him with a Twitch IRC client through which to read and write to twitch chat, and a number of functions to handle overhead. To contrast, he also has a **SinoperMidi** connection which simply wraps a midi Input class for him to read from.
