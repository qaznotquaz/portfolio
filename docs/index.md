Good morning, afternoon, or evening, and welcome to my portfolio! As a lifelong programmer, I've worked on quite a variety of projects and I'm always excited to discuss them with others. I've included my most interesting projects here to provide in-depth detail about each one - discussing the project's purpose and implementation details, as well as its history and the things it taught me. You can navigate to each project's homepage through the tabs across the top, and there will be a sidebar to navigate between the documents discussing a given project. Since this site itself is so fresh, I can only feature a small subset of the list of projects I plan to show off. My budding magnum opus project and domain namesake is the most recent incarnation of my chatbot and livestreaming assistant called Sinoper, and you can read more about him [here](/sinoper-v2). If you have questions about any of my projects - pages under construction or not - feel free to <a href="mailto:jess@sinoper.dev?subject=Portfolio" title="jess@sinoper.dev">email me</a>! My contact information is also provided at the bottom of the page.

Since this site is itself one of my projects, I'll take a moment here on the front page to discuss it. I'm hosting it through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which inherently supports building through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Although installing pre-made themes for Jekyll is pretty easy, I chose to write my themes entirely from scratch. My first scratch website like this was my [Library](/library) project, and the theme I wrote for that site was my starting point for this site. All of the HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and Liquid implemented here has been developed firsthand, with the help of a lot of research. The development timeline for the Library's theme is discussed [here](/library#timeline). From that basis, the theme for this website was almost entirely developed between **June 23rd, 2022** and **June 26th, 2022**.
